### 🔍 **Stuff I've Built & Broken (Mostly Built)**

- **[UART Protocol Simulation in Verilog](https://github.com/Rupesh1510/UART-sim-in-Verilog-DD-CP)**  
  Crafted a sleek, efficient UART protocol simulator in Verilog with 115200 bits/s baud rate, clocking at 25 MHz. No nonsense, just raw communication power. 

- **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Solar Charge Controller**  
  Developed a low-cost Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller to track the max power point like a tech bloodhound using the Perturb and Observe algorithm. This isn't just another charger—this one’s all about efficiency and getting every last drop of energy from the sun!

### 💼 **Where I Get to Play with Big Boy Toys**

- **Specialist Engineer, Whirlpool of India Ltd.** *(Jan 2023 - Present)*  
  - Proposed a power-saving solution that reduced standby power in domestic appliances by over **60%**! 🌍⚡
  - Implemented UART communication between control boards—because when things need to talk, I make it happen.
  - Part of the Whirlpool Innovation Challenge, working to make technology more accessible for everyone.

- **Electronics Engineer Intern, Tata Centre for Technology & Design (IIT Bombay)** *(July 2022 - Dec 2022)*  
  - Helped design a **Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)** device for diagnosing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)—because tech and health should always be a team.
  - Developed an infusion pump controller for Chemotherapy patients at Tata Memorial Hospital. Precision flow control, **down to 5ml/hr**.
  - Used a bunch of cool prototyping tools (3D printing, laser cutting, PCB fabrication) to bring ideas into the physical world 🌟.
